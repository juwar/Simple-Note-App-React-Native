Here is my new repository which builded with React Native Framework for making the User Interface in JavaScript syntax, see my previous repository about [Simple App Note RestAPI](https://github.com/juwar/simpleAppNoteRestAPI) for the backend side and making API.

## Requirements
1. npm (node package manager)
2. react-native-cli (from npm)

## How to run the app ?
1. Previously, you had to use my previous project [Simple App Note RestAPI](https://github.com/juwar/simpleAppNoteRestAPI)
2. Clone or download first this repository with `git clone https://github.com/juwar/Simple-Note-App-React-Native/`
3. Open the project in your favorite text editor
